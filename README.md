# advent-of-code
My entries to the Advent of Code Competition.

So far I have only participated in the 2021 competition. My code for each day is stored in the 2021 folder. I used the R language to solve the challenges and my code is largely Tidyverse flavoured, making heavy use of dataframes.

Feedback welcome!
