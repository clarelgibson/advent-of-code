# Advent of Code
My entries to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) competition.

I am a data analyst rather than a programmer. My language of choice is R and I think in rows, columns and tables. My solutions are more likely to be built with tibbles than loops. I don't have the most efficient solutions but I get there, eventually. I won't be challenging the leaderboards.

I like to do some of my thinking in a spreadsheet using the example data, before moving into R. You can see my spreadsheet thinking [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QV5tuc7Q67WZB13N2MdI6zasyrKXKoZg?usp=sharing).

Feedback welcome!
