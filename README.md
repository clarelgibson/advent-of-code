# Advent of Code
My entries to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) competition.

I am a data analyst rather than a programmer. My lnguage of choice is R and I think in rows, columns and tables. My solutions are more likely to be built with tibbles than loops. I don't have the most efficient solutions but I get there, eventually. I won't be challenging the leaderboards.

Feedback welcome!
