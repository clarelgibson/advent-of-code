# OK, we need to see which printing satisfies the orders. One way is to extract

# ones via a join. Not very efficient, but who cares?

# we need only find which ones don't satisfy a rule, which can be done by reversing
# the rules and then semi_join()'ing (return rows that break the rules).

# Part 2

# We need to reorder the broken ones. This could be done with

# Alternatively, we can rank each observation by how often it
# appears in the order list on the left (conditional on another
# entry also being in the list:
